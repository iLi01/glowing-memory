      <p>KITE was formed in 1979 by a group of dedicated enthusiasts and has steadily progressed to become one of the UK's premier kite groups. 
        We organise many events throughout the year, including informal “fly-ins” where we not only fly kites, but also get the chance to talk 
        and exchange ideas on building and designing kites and discuss forthcoming events. We try to meet at least once a month, winter included, 
        at one of our many fly-in sites throughout the Midlands.</p>
